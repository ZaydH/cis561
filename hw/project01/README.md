## Installation Instructions

A build script is included for your convenience.  Simply run `./build.sh`.  This will create a binary file `project01`.

To run the program, simply call:

`bin/project01 <filename>`

## GitHub Repo

The GitHub repository cited in the config file **is a private repository.** I have sent you a collaborator invitation so you can download and use it.
