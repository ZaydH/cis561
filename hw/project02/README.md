## Installation Instructions

A build script is included for your convenience.  Simply run `./build.sh`.  This will create a binary file `project02`.

To run the program, simply call:

`bin/project02 <filename>`

Note that this code builds the AST along with parsing the code.  If it successfully parses and the debug flag `-t` is specified, the code prints what it believes is a correct representation of the original source.  Note that the printed order of the classes as well as the methods within a class may not match the original source.

## GitHub Repo

The GitHub repository cited in the config file **is a private repository.** I have sent you a collaborator invitation so you can download and use it.
